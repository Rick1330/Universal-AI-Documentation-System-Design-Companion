# Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer

## Overview

The Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer is a powerful, AI-driven system designed to empower users to effortlessly unlock insights from any type of data. In an era of information overload, where data is scattered across diverse formats like PDFs, images, web links, spreadsheets, and documents, this system offers a unified solution to automatically extract, clean, structure, and analyze information.

Manually processing such varied data is typically time-consuming, error-prone, and resource-intensive. The Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer tackles this challenge head-on by leveraging advanced AI agents, sophisticated data processing pipelines, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform raw, heterogeneous data into actionable intelligence. The system aims to democratize data extraction and analysis, making these critical capabilities accessible and efficient for a wide range of users, regardless of their technical expertise.

## Key Features (MVP)

*   **Versatile File Upload:** Supports initial common file types including PDF (.pdf), Plain Text (.txt), and Comma-Separated Values (.csv).
*   **Intelligent Data Extraction:** Employs AI agents to extract textual content, identify and parse simple tabular structures, and recognize common key fields from documents.
*   **Automated Data Cleaning:** Performs basic normalization tasks such as trimming whitespace, standardizing date formats, and cleaning numeric values to ensure data quality.
*   **Insightful Analysis:** Provides text summarization, calculates descriptive statistics for tabular data, and extracts relevant keywords to offer initial insights.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Presents extracted data and analysis results in an intuitive interface, including basic charting capabilities for visual understanding.
*   **Data Export:** Allows users to download the extracted and structured data in CSV format for further use.

## Purpose

The core purpose of the Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer is to eliminate the friction and complexity associated with extracting and making sense of data from disparate sources. By automating these processes, the system aims to:

*   **Save Time and Resources:** Drastically reduce the manual effort required for data handling.
*   **Improve Accuracy:** Minimize human errors in data extraction and transcription.
*   **Accelerate Decision-Making:** Provide quick access to structured data and analytical insights.
*   **Unlock Hidden Value:** Enable users to leverage information previously locked within inaccessible file formats.
*   **Enhance Productivity:** Allow users to focus on higher-value analytical tasks rather than data preparation.

## Technology

The system is built on a modern, scalable technology stack, featuring a Python backend with FastAPI, Celery for asynchronous task processing, and PostgreSQL for data management. The AI capabilities are powered by leading Large Language Models (e.g., OpenAI GPT series) orchestrated via frameworks like LangChain, and specialized libraries for OCR, PDF processing, and data manipulation. The frontend is designed to be built with Lovable.dev for a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Getting Started (Conceptual)

While this document outlines the design, a typical user interaction would involve:
1.  Uploading a file through the web interface.
2.  The system processes the file through its extraction, cleaning, and analysis pipeline.
3.  The user views the extracted data, summaries, and visualizations on their dashboard.
4.  The user can then download the structured data.

## Future Development

The Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer is envisioned to evolve with expanded file type support (images, DOCX, XLSX, web links), more advanced AI extraction and analysis capabilities (complex tables, handwriting recognition, sentiment analysis, trend identification), enhanced user customization, and integration options via an API.

This project aims to set a high standard in AI-powered data processing, delivering a robust, reliable, and user-centric solution.
