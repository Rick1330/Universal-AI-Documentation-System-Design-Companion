# UI/UX Design and Frontend Structure (Lovable.dev)

This document outlines the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) flow for the Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer, along with a proposed frontend structure leveraging Lovable.dev. The design prioritizes simplicity, intuitiveness, and a clear presentation of information to accommodate users with varying levels of technical expertise.

## 1. User Journey / UI/UX Flow (MVP)

The core user journey for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will be straightforward, focusing on the primary task of uploading a file and receiving extracted data and basic analysis.

**Step 1: Landing and File Upload**
*   **View:** Main Upload Page.
*   **Description:** The user lands on a clean, welcoming page. The primary call to action is to upload a file.
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   Clear system title: "Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer".
    *   Brief tagline explaining the system's purpose (e.g., "Unlock insights from your documents and data").
    *   A prominent file upload area (e.g., drag-and-drop zone or a "Select File" button).
    *   Clear indication of supported file types for MVP (PDF, TXT, CSV) and any size limitations.
    *   Optional: A link to a brief "How it Works" or FAQ section (stretch goal for MVP).
*   **User Action:** The user selects a file from their local system or drags it into the upload zone.

**Step 2: File Upload and Processing Initiation**
*   **View:** Upload Page (with feedback).
*   **Description:** Once a file is selected, the system provides immediate feedback.
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   Display of the selected file name and size.
    *   A "Start Processing" or "Extract & Analyze" button becomes active.
    *   Option to cancel/remove the selected file before processing.
*   **User Action:** User clicks the "Start Processing" button.

**Step 3: Processing State**
*   **View:** Processing Page / In-place feedback on Upload Page.
*   **Description:** The system indicates that the file is being processed. This is crucial for managing user expectations, as AI processing can take time.
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   A progress indicator (e.g., loading spinner, progress bar - could be an estimate or just an active state indicator for MVP).
    *   A message like "Processing your file... This may take a few moments."
    *   The interface should remain responsive, not freeze.
    *   (Stretch Goal): Real-time updates on the stage of processing (e.g., "Extracting text...", "Analyzing data...").
*   **User Action:** User waits for processing to complete.

**Step 4: Results Display**
*   **View:** Results Page (this could be a new page/view or a dynamic update of the current page).
*   **Description:** Once processing is complete, the results are presented in a structured and easily digestible format.
*   **UI Layout (Tabbed or Sectioned):**
    *   **a. Overview/Summary Tab:**
        *   Displays the generated text summary (from the Analyzer Agent).
        *   Lists extracted keywords.
        *   Shows overall insights generated by the Analyzer Agent.
    *   **b. Extracted Data Tab:**
        *   **Full Text View:** A scrollable area displaying the full extracted text content (from `full_text_content`).
        *   **Key-Value Pairs View:** Clearly lists the extracted key-fields and their values (from `key_fields`).
        *   **Tables View:** If tables were extracted, each table is displayed in a clean, readable grid format. Users might be able to select which table to view if multiple are present.
    *   **c. Analysis & Charts Tab:**
        *   **Descriptive Statistics:** For each analyzed table, display the calculated statistics for numeric columns (mean, median, min, max, etc.).
        *   **Frequency Counts:** Display frequency counts for categorical data.
        *   **Basic Chart:** Display the MVP bar chart (e.g., based on a selected numeric column from an extracted table).
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   Clear headings for each section.
    *   Copy-to-clipboard buttons for text blocks or individual data points.
    *   A prominent "Download Extracted Data (CSV)" button.
    *   Option to "Process Another File" returning to the upload page.
*   **User Action:** User reviews the extracted data and analysis, interacts with tabs, and can choose to download the results.

**Step 5: Data Export**
*   **View:** Results Page.
*   **Description:** User can download the structured data.
*   **User Action:** User clicks the "Download Extracted Data (CSV)" button. The browser initiates a download of a CSV file containing the structured information (likely focusing on tabular data and key-value pairs).

## 2. Frontend Structure (Lovable.dev)

The frontend will be developed using Lovable.dev, focusing on creating a modular and reusable component-based architecture.

### Key Pages/Views (Conceptual within Lovable.dev):

1.  **`UploadPage`:**
    *   Handles the initial landing, file input, and initiation of the processing job.
    *   May dynamically update to show processing status or transition to a dedicated processing view.
2.  **`ResultsPage`:**
    *   Displays all extracted and analyzed information.
    *   Likely uses tabbed navigation or expandable sections to organize content.
3.  **`ProcessingView` (Optional, could be part of `UploadPage`):**
    *   A dedicated view or modal to show active processing, especially if more detailed progress steps are shown in the future.

### Reusable Components/Blocks (Lovable.dev):

*   **`FileUploadComponent`:**
    *   Encapsulates the drag-and-drop zone, file input button, and display of selected file information.
    *   Handles file validation (type, size) on the client-side before upload.
*   **`ProcessingIndicatorComponent`:**
    *   A reusable spinner, progress bar, or animation to indicate active processing.
*   **`ResultsDisplayTabsComponent`:**
    *   Manages the tabbed navigation for the Results Page (Overview, Extracted Data, Analysis).
*   **`TextViewerComponent`:**
    *   A formatted, scrollable component for displaying large blocks of text (e.g., full extracted text) with a copy button.
*   **`KeyValueDisplayComponent`:**
    *   Renders key-value pairs in a clean, two-column layout.
*   **`DataTableComponent`:**
    *   Displays tabular data in a sortable, potentially paginated grid. Each extracted table would use an instance of this component.
*   **`StatsDisplayComponent`:**
    *   Presents descriptive statistics in a structured format.
*   **`ChartComponent`:**
    *   A wrapper for the chosen charting library (e.g., Chart.js) to render visualizations based on provided data.
*   **`DownloadButtonComponent`:**
    *   Standardized button for initiating downloads.
*   **`HeaderComponent` / `FooterComponent`:**
    *   Consistent site navigation and branding elements.
*   **`NotificationComponent`:**
    *   For displaying success messages, errors, or warnings to the user.

### Layout Considerations with Lovable.dev:

*   **Responsive Design:** The layout must be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
*   **Clarity and Readability:** Prioritize clear typography, sufficient whitespace, and a logical flow of information.
*   **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility best practices (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes) to ensure the application is usable by as many people as possible.
*   **Lovable.dev Capabilities:** Leverage Lovable.devâ€™s strengths in visual development, component creation, and potentially its built-in state management or data binding features to accelerate UI development.
*   **API Integration:** Frontend components will interact with the backend API (via the API Gateway) to upload files, poll for job status, and fetch results. Frontend services/functions will encapsulate this logic.

## 3. Project Structure and Separation of Concerns

As detailed in the "GitHub Repository Layout" document (`04_github_repo_layout.md`), the project maintains a strict separation of concerns:

*   **Frontend (`frontend/lovable-project/`):** The Lovable.dev project will reside entirely within this dedicated directory. Its build artifacts will be self-contained or served as per Lovable.dev's deployment mechanisms.
*   **Backend (`backend/`):** All Python-based backend services, AI logic, and database interactions are located here, developed and deployable independently of the frontend.
*   **Shared Resources:**
    *   **`docs/`**: Contains all user-facing and technical documentation, including this UI/UX guide.
    *   **`prompts/`**: Stores AI agent prompts, which are conceptually part of the backend logic but versioned separately for clarity.
    *   **`config/`**: Holds non-sensitive configurations. Sensitive details are managed via environment variables.
    *   **`data/`**: Contains sample data for testing, not production user data.

This separation ensures that frontend development using Lovable.dev can proceed with a clear interface contract (the API) to the backend, and that documentation and AI prompt engineering can evolve alongside the core application components.

This UI/UX flow and frontend structure provides a solid foundation for the MVP of the Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer, with clear paths for future enhancements and feature additions.
