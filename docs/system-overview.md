# System Overview: Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer

## 1. Introduction

The Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer is an advanced AI-powered system engineered to address the pervasive challenge of extracting, processing, and analyzing data from a multitude of diverse file formats. Its primary objective is to provide a seamless, automated pipeline that transforms raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data—whether from PDFs, text files, spreadsheets, images, or web links—into structured, actionable insights. This document provides a high-level technical description of the system, its purpose, core functionalities, and the value it delivers to users ranging from business analysts and researchers to data scientists and general knowledge workers.

## 2. System Purpose and Value Proposition

### Problem Domain

Organizations and individuals are frequently confronted with valuable information locked within heterogeneous data sources. Manual extraction and processing are not only labor-intensive and slow but also prone to errors, creating significant bottlenecks in workflows that rely on timely data. The inability to efficiently harness this data impedes analysis, insight generation, and informed decision-making.

### Core Purpose

The Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer is designed to:

*   **Automate Data Ingestion:** Accept a wide array of file types as input.
*   **Intelligently Extract Data:** Utilize AI, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Optical Character Recognition (OCR), to identify and extract key textual content, tabular data, and specific fields.
*   **Normalize and Clean Data:** Apply automated cleaning routines to ensure data consistency and quality.
*   **Analyze and Summarize:** Perform analytical operations to uncover trends, generate summaries, and identify key insights.
*   **Present Results Intuitively:** Offer a user-friendly interface for viewing extracted data, analytical results, and visualizations.

### Value Proposition

*   **Efficiency:** Drastically reduces the time and effort spent on manual data extraction and preparation.
*   **Accuracy:** Minimizes human error through automated processing and AI-driven validation.
*   **Accessibility:** Makes complex data processing capabilities available to users without deep technical expertise.
*   **Scalability:** Designed to handle varying loads and data volumes through a modern, microservices-based architecture.
*   **Insight Acceleration:** Enables faster derivation of insights, supporting more agile and data-driven decision-making.

## 3. Key Functionalities (MVP Focus)

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will deliver the core end-to-end workflow:

*   **File Input:** Users can upload files in common formats (PDF, TXT, CSV).
*   **Extraction Engine:** An AI-driven backend processes these files:
    *   Extracts full text from PDFs and TXT files.
    *   Parses rows and columns from CSV files.
    *   Attempts to identify and extract simple tables from PDFs.
    *   Identifies a predefined set of common key fields (e.g., invoice number, date, total) from supported document types using LLMs and pattern matching.
*   **Cleaning Module:** Performs basic data normalization:
    *   Trims extraneous whitespace.
    *   Standardizes common date formats (e.g., to ISO 8601).
    *   Cleans numeric values by removing currency symbols and commas.
*   **Analysis Module:** Generates initial insights:
    *   Provides concise summaries for text-heavy documents.
    *   Calculates descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max, count) for numeric data in tables.
    *   Extracts and lists key terms or phrases.
*   **Results Presentation:**
    *   Displays extracted raw text and structured data (tables, key-value pairs) in a clear format.
    *   Shows analytical summaries and keyword lists.
    *   Offers basic charting (e.g., bar chart) for one user-selected numeric column.
*   **Data Export:** Allows users to download the extracted structured data as a CSV file.

## 4. High-Level Technical Approach

The system employs a distributed architecture composed of several key technical layers:

*   **Frontend:** A web-based user interface (built with Lovable.dev) for file uploads, interaction, and results visualization.
*   **Backend API:** A set of services built with Python (FastAPI) to handle requests, manage jobs, and orchestrate the data processing pipeline.
*   **AI Core:** This includes:
    *   **AI Agents (Extractor, Cleaner, Analyzer):** Logical components that use LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT series via LangChain/LlamaIndex), specialized Python libraries (e.g., PyMuPDF, Pandas, Tesseract OCR), and custom algorithms to perform their respective tasks.
    *   **Asynchronous Task Processing:** Celery workers manage long-running operations like file parsing, OCR, and complex analysis, ensuring the API remains responsive.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   **Object Storage (e.g., MinIO/S3):** For storing uploaded raw files and potentially large processed outputs.
    *   **Relational Database (PostgreSQL):** For managing job metadata, user information (stretch goal), structured extracted data, and system configurations.
    *   **Message Broker (e.g., RabbitMQ/Redis):** For queuing tasks between the API services and Celery workers.

## 5. Workflow Overview

1.  **Upload:** User uploads a file via the frontend.
2.  **Ingestion:** The backend receives the file, stores it, and creates a processing job.
3.  **Processing Queue:** The job is dispatched to an asynchronous task queue.
4.  **AI Agent Pipeline:** A Celery worker picks up the job and executes the AI agent chain:
    *   **Extractor Agent:** Parses the file, performs OCR if necessary, and extracts raw data (text, tables, key fields).
    *   **Cleaner Agent:** Normalizes and cleans the extracted data.
    *   **Analyzer Agent:** Processes the cleaned data to generate summaries, statistics, and insights.
5.  **Results Storage:** Processed data and analysis results are stored in the database and/or object storage.
6.  **Presentation:** The frontend retrieves and displays the results to the user, including any visualizations.
7.  **Export:** The user can download the structured data.

## 6. Future Enhancements (Stretch Goals)

The system is designed for extensibility, with future plans including:

*   Support for a wider range of file types (images, DOCX, XLSX, web URLs).
*   Advanced extraction capabilities (complex tables, handwriting, user-defined fields).
*   Sophisticated cleaning and analysis features (sentiment analysis, trend detection, natural language querying).
*   Enhanced UI/UX with interactive annotation and richer visualizations.
*   API access for programmatic integration.

This system overview provides a foundational understanding of the Universal Data Extractor + Analyzer, its capabilities, and its technical underpinnings. More detailed information on specific components and processes can be found in the accompanying architecture and agent design documents.
